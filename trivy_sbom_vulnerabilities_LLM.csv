In affected versions an attacker may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF.

The initial vulnerability identified in Streamlit apps using custom components, allowing for directory traversal attacks, was addressed in version 1.11.1. However, a minor issue persisted, which could still potentially expose certain files on the server file-system under specific conditions.

### Patches

We released an update in version 1.30.0 to further tighten security measures. Users are strongly advised to update to version 1.30.0 immediately for optimal security.

### Workarounds

No additional workarounds are necessary once the update to version 1.30.0 is applied.
